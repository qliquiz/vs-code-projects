        <h2 id="third-city">Berlin</h2>
        <p>Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany, the first in terms of population and the third largest city in the European Union.
            <br><br>Around 1200, two trading settlements — Kelln and Berlin - were located on the site of modern Berlin. The exact date of their city rights is unknown. The city rights of Kelln were first mentioned in 1237, the city rights of Berlin in 1244. In 1307, the cities united and formed a common city council. In 1400, the population of the united Berlin was 8000 people. The historical name "Kelln" is reflected in the name of the Berlin district of Neukeln.

            <br><br>After the Second World War, in accordance with the decisions of the Yalta Conference, Berlin, which was located on the territory of the Soviet zone of occupation of Germany, was divided by the four victorious powers into occupation sectors. Later, three sectors of the Allied occupation were transformed into West Berlin, which received the status of a special (albeit closely related to the FRG) state entity. Movement between the sectors of Berlin remained relatively free for a long time, and in order to prevent the leakage of population to the western sectors, the GDR government decided to erect the Berlin Wall, which surrounded West Berlin from August 13, 1961. It became one of the main symbols of the Cold War and was demolished only in 1989. After the unification of Germany in 1990, the reunited Berlin became its capital. In accordance with the decision of the Bundestag of June 20, 1991, the Parliament and the Government of Germany also moved to Berlin in 1999.
